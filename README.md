# GongBu

GongBu was inspired by the need to take notes in a more efficient manner. Visual learners have always benefited from formatting their notes, but current applications only allow them to do so through buttons that the user has to press in the middle of the note-taking process, therefore creating challenges for the user to take notes efficiently.

GongBu allows you to customize your own shortcuts to format your notes in any way. By incorporating short and simple custom tags while taking notes, your notes automatically get formatted the way you want them to be formatted. In a way - it is your own markdown language, but with much more formatting possibilities than markdown.
